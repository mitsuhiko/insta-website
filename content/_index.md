# Hello Snapshot Testing

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

Snapshots tests (also sometimes called approval tests) are tests that assert
values against a reference value (the snapshot).  Think of it as a supercharged
version of `assert_eq!`.  It lets you compare a value against a reference
value but unlike simple assertions the reference value is managed by `insta`
for you.

## What's in the Box?

* **Interactive snapshot reviews**: with `cargo-insta` you can perform reviews
  of all changed snapshots conveniently.
* **Inline snapshots**: insta can store snapshots right within your source file.
* **External snapshots**: it's also possible to store snapshots as separate files.
* **Redactions**: if you have output which can change between test runs (such as
  random identifiers, timestamps or others) you can instruct insta to redact these parts.
* **Flexible formats**: you can pick between snapshoting into different formats
  such as JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV or others.
* **Editor Support**: insta also provides a [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mitsuhiko.insta)
  that lets you review snapshots right from within your editor.
* **Pretty Diffs**: insta renders beautiful snapshot diffs right in your
  terminal with the help of the [similar](/similar/) crate.
* **Supports older Rust:** insta, similar and [similar-asserts](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/similar-asserts) support Rust down to 1.41.
* **Apache-2.0 licensed**: because the best tools are Open Source under a convenient license.

## What Does This Look Like?

Pretty simple.  You write a test function where you perform some sort of
computation and then use one of the `insta` provided assertion macros:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_simple() {
    insta::assert_yaml_snapshot!(calculate_value());
}
```

Note that no reference value is provided.  Instead the reference value is placed
on the first test run in a separate snapshot file.  Insta will automatically
manage that snapshot for you.

## Test Workflow

This is what this process looks like in an actual example:

<div class="termcast"><img src="demo.svg" alt=""></div>
